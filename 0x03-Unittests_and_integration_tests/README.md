0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests
Description
This project focuses on writing unittests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of your code. Testing is a crucial part of the software development process, allowing developers to identify and fix bugs early, and maintain code quality over time.

Objectives
Understand the difference between unit tests and integration tests.

Learn how to write effective unit tests.

Implement integration tests to ensure components work together as expected.

Use Python’s unittest module to create and run tests.

Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on testing individual units or components of the code in isolation. Each test case ensures that a specific function or method behaves as expected under various conditions.

Integration Tests
Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. They help identify issues that arise when components are integrated.
